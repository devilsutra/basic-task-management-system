## üí° Usage

1.  **Register:** On the `register.html` page, create a new user account. The system includes a basic password strength indicator.
2.  **Login:** Use your newly registered (or default "devil") credentials to log in via `index.html`.
3.  **Dashboard:** Upon successful login, you'll be redirected to the `dashboard.html`. Here, you'll see:
    *   Key statistics: Total Tasks, Active Employees, Completed Tasks, and Pending Tasks.
    *   Quick action links to navigate to task and employee management pages.
    *   A dynamic "Recent Activity" feed that updates automatically as actions are performed.
4.  **Manage Tasks (`tasks.html`):**
    *   **Add New Task:** Use the form to create new tasks, add a description, and assign them to an active employee.
    *   **View All Tasks:** See a comprehensive list of all tasks, their descriptions, assigned employees, and current status.
    *   **Mark as Complete:** Click the "Complete" button for any pending or in-progress task to mark it as finished.
    *   **Delete Task:** Remove tasks from the list using the "Delete" button.
5.  **Manage Employees (`employees.html`):**
    *   **Add New Employee:** Easily add new team members. They will be added as "active" by default.
    *   **View Employee List:** See all registered employees, their current status, and if they have a current task.
    *   **Toggle Status:** Change an employee's status between "active" and "inactive".
    *   **Delete Employee:** Permanently remove an employee. **Note:** Deleting an employee will automatically unassign any tasks previously assigned to them.
6.  **Dynamic Updates:** All changes made in task or employee management (adding, completing, deleting, status changes) are reflected immediately on the Dashboard's statistics and Recent Activity feed, providing a real-time overview.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

This project currently uses `LocalStorage` for simplicity. For a production-ready application, significant enhancements would include:

*   **Backend Integration:** Transition from `LocalStorage` to a server-side backend (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask, PHP with Laravel) and a robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL) for:
    *   Scalable data storage.
    *   Multi-user data isolation.
    *   Enhanced security for user credentials.
*   **User Roles and Permissions:** Implement different levels of access (e.g., Admin, Manager, Employee) with varying privileges.
*   **Task Editing:** Add functionality to edit existing task details (title, description, assigned employee, status).
*   **Advanced Task Features:** Add due dates, priorities, categories, and recurrence options for tasks.
*   **Task Filtering & Sorting:** Allow users to filter tasks by status, employee, or sort them by various criteria.
*   **Notifications System:** Implement real-time notifications for task assignments, status changes, and due dates.
*   **Reporting & Analytics:** Expand the "View Reports" section with interactive charts and more detailed analytical data.
*   **Improved Error Handling:** More robust error messages and user feedback.
*   **Search Functionality:** Add search bars for tasks and employees.
